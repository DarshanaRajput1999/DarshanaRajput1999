**üöÄ About Me****

I'm Darshana Rajput, a data analyst with a passion for translating complex data into actionable insights that drive strategic decisions and foster business growth. Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Data Analytics at Boston University,I bring over 4 years of experience in data analysis, business intelligence, and machine learning. With a strong foundation in computer science from NMIMS University, I am proficient in wide range of technologies and tools, including Python, SQL, and advanced data visualization platforms  like Power BI and Tableau.

At Boston University,I leverage my skills to conduct advanced data analysis and develop innovative solutions for real-world problems. Previously, I worked as a Data Analyst where I excelled in translating complex business problems into actionable insights through SQL and Python. I designed and implemented robust data solutions using Azure Data Platform, enhanced data visualization with Power BI, and led projects that optimized performance and drove business growth. My background in computer science from NMIMS University complements my data expertise, enabling me to tackle diverse challenges and deliver impactful results.

My projects showcase my expertise and creativity. For instance, I developed a predictive model for identifying depressive disorders with 80% accuracy and engineered a fraud detection system that achieved 95% accuracy.
These experiences highlight my ability to solve complex problems and deliver high-quality, data-driven solutions.

Fueled by curiosity and a dedication to ongoing learning, I constantly seek innovative methods to tackle complex problems and reveal new data-driven opportunities. I excel in collaborative settings and thrive on projects that leverage data for impactful, creative solutions.
